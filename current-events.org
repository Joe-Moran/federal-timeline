IGs were fired without providing congress thirty day notice as is required. Many consider this to be unconstitutional and that Trump will replace independent employees with loyalists.

IGs are meant to be impartial and do long-term audits to find waste, fraud, and abuse. In fact, their websites coined the phrase "waste, fraud, and abuse" before it became a Trump and DOGE talking point. IGs would provide reports on their audits, which are publicly available, suggesting to congress to take action and the monetary/legal results of those actions.

#+BEGIN_QUOTE
Before folks overreact to headlines about the judge’s ruling in the Khalil case, please note that (1) it was an immigration judge (IJ), not a federal district court; and (2) the IJ had no power to consider Khalil’s constitutional objections.

This particular decision was a fait accompli.

DOJ tried claiming client-attorney privilege on several details, which the judges were not happy with.

Motion to Compel:
#+BEGIN_QUOTE
The defendants claim that they did not violate the preliminary injunction because they
"determined, after a particularized assessment," that the employees they RIFed were "unnecessary to the performance of [CFPB's] statutory duties." To support this assertion, they submitted a declaration from Mark Paoletta, the Chief Legal Officer of the CFPB, claiming to have conducted the required assessment-along with Victoria Dorfman and Daniel Shapiro. Paoletta Decl. 1 6.
Yet now, the defendants seek to withhold information related to how they conducted that supposed assessment under the guise of privilege. They cannot have it both ways. The defendants cannot rely on Paoletta's testimony and then shield the documents that would enable the plaintiffs and the
Court to assess that testimony. Given the centrality of Paoletta's purported assessment to the show-
cause hearing, this Court should reject (or at least investigate in camera) the defendants' attempts
to hide the discussions regarding this very assessment.
